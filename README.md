# transaction-tracker-reactjs

This project acts as my introduction to building a local full-stack application using ReactJS for the frontend and Flask API in Python connected to an SQLite3 database for the backend.
You can install the required code and dependencies by referring to the zip file.

In this simple-to-use application, you can upload your every day financial transactions and store your data on a local database! You can input INCOME or EXPENSE transactions and categorize them by type.
There is also a built-in Expense Summary component that visualizes a percent-breakdown of your Expenses according to the specified date range period. Users can also play around with the date range filter to visualize the relevant data they want.
The frontend is interactive with the backend database, so you can also hover over a data record and right-click to delete it!
